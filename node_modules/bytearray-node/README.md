# ByteArray-node

A Node.js implementation of the Actionscript 3 ByteArray. I made this library so that Actionscript developers using ByteArray in their application are more likely to switch to Node.js. This library is exactly the same as the one in Actionscript, so it's very easy!

# Installation

`npm install bytearray-node`

# Usage

```javascript
const ByteArray = require("bytearray-node")
const ba = new ByteArray()

ba.writeByte(1)
ba.writeShort(5)

ba.position = 0

console.log(ba.readByte()) // 1
```
